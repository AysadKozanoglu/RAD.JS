# Introduction

Take the Tour of Heroes Tutorial which picks up from where the QuickStart leaves off and builds a simple data-driven app. Simple, yes, but with the essential characteristics we'd expect of a professional application: a sensible project structure, data binding, master/detail, services, dependency injection, navigation, animation, working with 3-rd party labriries and remote data access.

В качестве спецификации приложения мы возмем приложение *"Tour of Heroes"* из туториала по Angular 2.
